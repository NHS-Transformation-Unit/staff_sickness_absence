## Sickness Absence Data
Most of the data for this analysis was sourced from the [Sickness Absence](https://digital.nhs.uk/data-and-information/publications/statistical/nhs-sickness-absence-rates) 
datasets published each month by NHS England (formerly NHS Digital). The data can be downloaded on a monthly basis. However, for ease of the analysis 
carried out the data itself was sourced from the curated dataset stored within [UDAL](https://www.england.nhs.uk/contact-us/privacy-notice/data-analytics/) environment.

## NHS Staff Survey
The NHS Staff Survey has also been used within this analysis. The data has been downloaded from the 
interactive dashboard available [here](https://nhssurveys.co.uk/nss/survey-information/).
